# Calculator-with-Flask

This is a simple web application built with Flask that provides a postfix calculator. It allows users to enter infix expressions, which are then converted to postfix notation and evaluated to obtain the result. The application supports basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) and parentheses for grouping.
